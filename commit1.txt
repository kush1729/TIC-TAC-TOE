Added a very simple user interface
Basically use the same screen but fill with white
Then add whatever was to be added to the screen

Also, when user clicks on a button, and the screen changes, then sometimes an action (say a button click event) is triggered
So for example when user clicks on multi, it automatically chooses middle cell in the game board etc

To counter this a delay timer has been added, so that the screen changes after the computer stops sensing a click event

Proposed:
Improve user interface
