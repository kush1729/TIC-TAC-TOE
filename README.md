# Tic-Tac-Toe

## A simple console-based game

Traditional Tic-Tac-Toe through console.

### Features (not all implemented)

You can play against:

- Another player on the same computer
- The computer (ideally unbeatable)

The computer uses a brute-force algorithm searching all possible games for the best strategy.

The GUI is very basic. It uses the same display but keeps overlaying the old screen with the new screen.

### Proposed improvements

- Play with an opponent over a network or the internet
- Improve the GUI
- Possibly extend the game from a 3x3 grid to a 4x4 or a 5x5
